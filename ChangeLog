	* flipping.php:
	Added this file that just displays 'flipping the coin...' and then
	redirects to flipcoin.php.  This adds a nice feeling of suspense.
	* boccelib.php:
	Added the 'checkdifferent' function to assert that two things are
	different.
	* startgame.php:
	Added a check so that the same person can't login twice.

	* flipcoin.php:
	Added this file which implements most of the functionality of
	coinflipping support.
	* boccelib.php:
	Moved some functions from statslib.php into here.  The functions didn't
	have much to do with statistics and they were needed on pages that
	didn't have anything to do with statistics.  This seems like a better
	fit for them.
	* statslib.php:
	Moved some functions into boccelib.php.
	Added statistics for tracking coinflip win percentage and total number
	of coinflips won.
	* addscore.php:
	Added the coinflip_winner to the query that writes to the game table.
	* statistics.php:
	Exposed the coinflip_winner statistics.
	* startgame.php:
	Moved the responsibility of picking the ball color from here to the
	flipcoin.php page.

	* statistics.php:

	win percentage and deuces per game for each ball in the system overall
	* statslib.php:
