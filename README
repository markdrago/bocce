About
=====
This is the Office Bocce Score Tracking System.  It is used to power
officebocce.com.  This project started as a simple way to track the bocce
games that we played at work.  It is now the foremost recognized office bocce
score tracking system in what has turned into an international, multi-million
dollar industry.  It generates a rediculous number of statistics from a few
simple facts about any given game.  It aims to be everything to everybody.
